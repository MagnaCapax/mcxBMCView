# Development

Start here if you change this repository, by hand or with a coding agent.

## Read first

1. [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md): the rules for this repository, short.
2. [Engineering principles](engineering-principles.md): the same rules with their reasons and the mistakes that taught them. Copied from the canonical copy in mcxPikkumies; change that one first.
3. [Decision records](../docs/adr/): accepted ADRs are binding. A significant change ships with a new one ([template](../docs/adr/0000-template.md)). Start with [ADR-0001](../docs/adr/0001-architecture-layout-and-languages.md), which describes the layout, the languages and why the browser layer is Node.
4. [README](../README.md): what the tools do, install, usage, how the BMC login flow works, and the known limitations.

## Before you commit

There is no test suite and no CI; `package.json` defines no test script. Run what exists:

- `node --check <file>.js` on every JavaScript file you changed, and `bash -n <file>` on every wrapper you changed.
- The real check needs a BMC: run the changed tool against a supported board (see the compatibility table in the README) with `BMC_DEBUG=1`, and say in the commit what you ran it against and what it returned. Do not commit screenshots; `.gitignore` excludes them.
- New logic that can run without a BMC (key parsing, argument handling) has a test that fails when the logic is broken (break it once and see).
- Review the change with the [review unit](https://github.com/MagnaCapax/mcxPikkumies/tree/main/pikkumies/tools/development/code-review): correctness, an adversarial pass, weakness classes, and conformance to `AGENTS.md`, the ADRs and the principles. Any agent can follow its `skill.md`.
- No model provider or model name, no internal hostname or address, no credential or default password, no customer data and nothing else that is not meant for the public: this repository is public.

Each has its own `AGENTS.md`, decision records and docs. When your change touches another project, read its records first.
